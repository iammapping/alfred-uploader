## alfred-uploader

An Alfred workflow to help you upload local images to cloud storage provider (just support [upyun](https://www.upyun.com/) now), and get back the public access url.



### Why create this?

Markdown is a great language to write a document, and generate a good looking. But it is unpleasant when you insert a local image into your document. If I share the document including some local images with others, the images will be lost. So I should upload the images to a cloud storage provider at first, and copy back the access url into my document. It's so complicated and repetitive. The real terrible thing is to write a document, I want to insert a image, after I finished these fucking steps, back to the document, I have forgotten what to write.

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) is a efficient tool for Mac. There is a great feature call **Workflows**, we can create a workflow to do the complicated and repetitive work. I'm a heavy user of Alfred, I use it to find files, open apps, translate, calculate and so on. Only you can not think, no you can not do. 

I can not stand to spend a lot of time waiting for the upload and copy again and again. So I create a workflow called **Uploader** to connect file input, image processing and url output.

With **Uploader**, if I want to insert a image while writing, use hotkey to open alfred, input "upload" keyword, select the image to upload, continue writing, just keep an eye on the upload success notification, paste the access url, that's all. My focus was always on the document I'm writing, alfred only disturbed for 1 to 3 seconds.

The all images in this document was uploaded by Uploader  proudly. Now let me introduce Uploader to you, you can get it from [alfred-uploader](https://github.com/iammapping/alfred-uploader).



### Setup

DownloadÂ [the latest release](https://github.com/iammapping/alfred-uploader/releases)Â and double-click the workflow file (with a *.alfredworkflow* extension). Alfred will install it automatically.

After installed, you can find it in **Alfred Preferences -> Workflows list**.

### Usage

Everything is ready. Let's upload. 

#### Upload

There are three ways to upload:

1. Input "upload" keyword, pick a file.  You can also filter the files with query.

   â€‹

2. locate a file in Alfred, select "Uploader" operation

   â€‹

3. select files in Finder, press hotkey "cmd+shift+s". I highly recommend this way, because it support multi files once.

Once you receive a notification said "ðŸ˜€Image upload success", it means the local image has been uploaded to remote, and the access url is ready in your clipboard, you can paste it directly.

> Tips: The first way, if you select a file with "alt (option)" key pressing, the result url will wrap a markdown img tag (\!\[\]\({url}\))



#### Uploaded

Use "uploaded" keyword to lookup the uploaded images, keeping 50 records by default,  query filter alse support.

As shown above, you can see the access url, the original file path and the upload time. Once you select a image, the access url copied, then paste it to anywhere you want. From last tips learned, the "alt" key also works here.



### TODO

- [ ] support S3
- [ ] remove the remote image
- [ ] don't upload repeated
- [ ] process image local, such as crop, resize... (To be discussed)
